We are headed towards a town. We take the kings road and head towards the location. We stay at the [[Bagel and Bed]] inn. And we ask a little more about the [[Sablewood]] and [[Hush]]. The tavern keeper tells us that there are no guides left in town because they are escorting some mercenaries to [[Hush]]. We should expect to get there in about a day and a half.

We have provisions already. We watch some of the fly fisherman cast some lines out.

We decide to leave the town and head towards the village of [[Hush]]. We are riding down the road in the wagon. As we ride we notice that the trees are seeping an odd maroon substance. We pull around a tight corner and there is an overturned cart in the middle of the road. There are boxes and things strewn about. There is a body and an Owl/Wolf hybrid chowing down on the body. [[Skyy]] collects some of the sap that [[Selene]] mentioned earlier. [[Sheldon]], [[Slate]] and [[Selene]] all stay by the cart. 

We see that they were ambushed or attacked. There are no crests. As we are looking around we are ambushed by some forest people coming out of the forest. [[Slate]] knocks over the cart to prevent the ambushers from stealing it but they end up grabbing the chest and running away into the forest. [[Sheldon]], [[Selene]] and [[Skyy]] chase them but get lost in the forest for a bit.

[[Selene]] communes with a nature spirit and it tells her how we can get to chest. We decide to travel towards [[Hush]] to look for the airship mentioned by the king and enlist their help to find the chest.

We come across another [[galapa]] on the road. They are named [[Will Skyled]]. We ask him to travel with us to [[Hush]]. His son's name is [[Dell Skyled]], who left his dad to be a wind sorcerer. We keep an eye out in the forest. We arrive at a spot with a large stone pillar. It is a pillar that denotes a farside of the village of [[Hush]]. We pass through it and here a bubble sound and now hear the sound of friendly voices.

We arrive in the village and there is the a festival going on. It is the [[First moss festival]]. [[Slate]] and [[Sheldon]] compete and gain some tickets. [[Skyy]] fails super hard and gets hurt during his challenge. [[Selene]] participates and is able to succeed on everything.

note:
If we go to [[Root's Hollow]], we can purify the sap that [[Skyy]] collected. It can be fermented to produce a powerful healing potion. It is in a t.own far north in the [[Sablewood]].

We head to the [[Clover Tavern]], a tavern in a large tree. We enter and ask after the [[White Fire Archanist]].  We learn she has a tower south of the village. We also learn that the ship's crew has rented the top floor of the tavern. We can speak with [[Halithon]] for more info on the [[thistlefolk]] and more information on the [[Wandering Brair]].

We learn that the captain of the airship is [[Captain Cane]]. They like drinking a [[bugbane berry wine]]. But has recently run out of it.

We decide to rest in the pub and end the session.
