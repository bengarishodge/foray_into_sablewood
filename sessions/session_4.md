We begin by trying to cross the [[Lucient River]]. The river is wide enough to sweep people way. [[Skyy]] approaches and speaks with a capibeara and convinces them to carry them across. We start heading across the river. We are able to navigate across the river. We a fungal looking person with bulbous eyes and goggles. He is dumping some items near the barrels.

[[Selene]] approaches the fungal person and they spot her. It welcomes her. It doesn't know where the [[Wandering Brair]] is currently but another tribes member [[Zen]] might know. [[Skyy]] fails to deceive the fungal person and so does [[Selene]]. It runs off into the village and alerts everyone. We all disarm and then approach the village. They let us into the village. There is a dwarf in the town, named [[Zen]]. She doesn't like [[Tharn]] and the [[Wandering Brair]]. We tell them our story. Their raids are too brazen now and so [[Zen]] asks us to depose [[Tharn]]. We ask for some help from [[Zen]] and ask about his capabilities.

[[Tharn]] is empowered by the briar. [[Zen]] can summon the [[Wandering Brair]] and help us get in.

We gather our weapons and are offered a place to long rest.

We decide to take [[Proven Nav'ir]] of the [[Six Spire Tangle]]. We ask what he can do an they say they can excrete. We need to run through his excretions in order to gain the benefits. 

We see the [[Wandering Brair]] approaching the village. We spot a crack in the wall and try to make our way through the briars. We manage to sneak into the [[Wandering Brair]].

[[Selene]] sneaks around the camp and finds some of the prisoners. We attack all of the dirty thistlers. We fight off [[Tharn]] and his minions and reclaim the chest. We free three people, a [[thistlefolk]], a merchant and a seaman.

We are awarded some gems. [[Sheldon]] takes a greatstone and attaches it to his battleaxe.

We hear the speaking orb speaking our pocket. [[White Fire Archanist]] is checking in on us. We decide to head back to [[Hush]]. We take a short rest. [[Zen]] gathers her people and we take off at a leisurly pace and head to [[Hush]].
