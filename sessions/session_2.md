We begin at the bottom floor of the tavern. [[Soil]] runs upstairs and the party chases after him. He jumps onto a table and knocks some papers and notes on the ground. [[Skyy]] helps pick them up and hand them back to the elf who hastily snatches them. He sees plans on an [[Astrolathe]] and notes saying they are looking for the lost treasure of [[Captain Kaigh]], a dead pirate captain. [[Slate]] tries to start up conversation about the ship and figure out what they are doing here. They say that the ship is grounded because they lost their security compliment a week ago.

We tell them that the king sent them reinforcements but tell [[K'less Surehand]] that the reinforcements were killed and taken prisoner by the [[thistlefolk]]. She says that she would let us know in the morning. We tell them that will be staying in town and that we will meet back up with them in the morning. We learn that the engineer's name is [[Malandra Silver]]. She was the elf.

We head towards the [[White Fire Archanist]] on the south side of town. We exit the tavern and we see that all of our shoes were cleaned with trinkets inside of them. [[Slate]] finds a box of shirt buttons. [[Skyy]] finds a fan when unfolded a has a picture of a maroon cat. [[Selene]] finds a bronze pentacle with a rat in its center. [[Sheldon]] get's a piece of crystal meth. We don't see the cleaners of the shoes anywhere.

We walk by crops like corn, onions and celery. We come upon the archanist's home who live in a tree house. There are faces carved in it.

We call out for the [[White Fire Archanist]] from the base of the tree. Nothing happens. [[Sheldon]] just flies up to the door and knocks. The [[White Fire Archanist]] is a fairy giant. She lowers the house and the party walks in. We tell her that we were ambushed by a group of [[thistlefolk]]. We tell her that we have a plan to recover it. Times are tough in the [[Sablewood]] and the [[thistlefolk]] are more willing to raid travelers. The roaming brier is their main settlement. The do have a camp south east of hush.

She gives us a speaking orb which we can use to communicate with her. She tells us that we should try to get the chest. While we are out we should also find some moonglow water, purified sablesap and a bugbane berry. If possible, we should find a eelagator egg. Eelagators live in the [[Lucient River]] and the moonglow water can be procured from the river but in the high falls. We also remember that we can purify the sap at [[Root's Hollow]].

We try to find lodging for the night. We head to the tavern to try and meet someone who will house us for the night. The dwarf takes notice of [[Sheldon]]'s axe. Every great weapon needs a name. Her name is [[Luli Standworth]]. We follow her home and sleep.

We meet up with [[K'less Surehand]] and she tells us that we are hired. She tells us that we can bring the [[thistlefolk]] hostage we have. We set sail.

We see [[Captain Cane]] and [[K'less Surehand]]. We introduce ourselves and tell us we can head towards the south west of hush to find the [[thistlefolk]]. They had an altercation with some sky pirates called the [[Crimson Cloud]]. We are shown around the ship by [[K'less Surehand]]. We start searching but are attacked by 2 [[greyscaled wyvern]]. 

We have a discussion about the mechanics of players.

We fight them off and [[Captain Cane]] thanks us for his help.

He invites us to dinner. [[Selene]]'s weasle [[Sif]] wraps around her neck like a scarf, [[Soil]] is wearing a leaf bow tie and [[Sheldon]] drew a tuxedo on his shell. We tell him our brief history and ask about [[Captain Cane]]'s and he says that he serves as a family tradition.

We offend him by asking about the engine but notice that [[Malandra Silver]] is focused on a case containing an [[astrolathe]]. We ask about the [[Archanists]] and learn that they are the protectors of  [[Sablewood]].

An alarm sounds and the ship lurches. Throwing everyone to the floor. We rush out of the room to see a small ship with red sails crash into the ship. We are being boarded by pirates! [[Sheldon]] flys over the horde and drops a grenade on them and kills most of them. [[Slate]] is thrown off the edge but is saved by [[Sheldon]]. Then [[Skyy]] gets bonked off the edge of the ship and managed to hang on to a sail. The captain of the pirate ship boards and begins searching for their wind mage.

Next time:
- We decide to head down to the second deck and pursue pirate captain
