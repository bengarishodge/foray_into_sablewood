We begin this session chasing the pirate captain through the second deck of the ship. [[Selene]] runs past much of the fighting and the remaining party members follow her. We are able to dodge all of the fighting. We descend to the lower deck and see the pirate captain enter a room before the party is intercepted by some pirates. We fight through the pirates and find a [[galapa]] being held captive being guarded by [[Malandra Silver]]. [[Selene]] tells her to run around. [[Malandra Silver]] resists and we hear commotion on the above deck. [[Cleopatra Crimson]], tries to reason with [[Malandra Silver]] but fails. We see that [[Captain Cane]] comes down the stairs. He says the party has seen too much and turns on the party. [[Selene]] murders [[Malandra Silver]] and [[Skyy]] frees the [[galapa]]. The captain enters the room and shoots and wounds [[Soil]]. Enraged, the party dumps some massive combos on the captain forcing him to retreat. A horde of sailors comes in an attacks the party.

We fight them off and kill the [[Captain Cane]] of the [[RAS Windfall]]. 

[[Selene]] and [[Sheldon]] loot the captain and the captain's quarters. The party escapes with the help of [[Cleopatra Crimson]].

We ask the pirates to drop us off at the [[Lucient River]] to talk with some [[thistlefolk]] about the location of the [[Wandering Brair]].

We level up to level 2.

The [[Crimson Cloud]] takes us to the [[Lucient River]]. [[Dell Skyled]] tells us that the [[Sablewood Senacure]] was reporting less goods. Because of this, we think that there might be an airship flying around and ambushing them. We remembered that the [[RAS Windfall]] was sent that the ship was sent by the kings advisor. We pay 2 handfuls of gold the the crew of the [[Crimson Cloud]] as reparations for killing some of their crew during the attack.

We arrive in the [[Lucient River]]. There is a luminescent glow coming off the river. We arrive in the evening. We ask them to drop us off at the high falls of the river.

We leave the ship.

We see that the moonglow river is at the bottom of the falls. We traverse down the cliff and reach the bottom of the falls.

We reach the moonglow water and [[Selene]] drinks a whole bunch of it. It tastes like sparkling water. We collect some moonglow water for the [[White Fire Archanist]].

[[Selene]] searches for an eeligator nest and she doesn't notice some eeligators slip into the water. We are ambushed by the eeligators and fight them off. We pick up the sole eeligator from the clutch. [[Sheldon]] heals both [[Skyy]] and [[Selene]].

[[Skyy]] summons a kangarat familiar named Joseph. We see some barrels floating in the river.

Next time:
- cross the river and investigate the barrels that likely belong to the [[thistlefolk]]
- [[Skyy]] has a familiar. Can't use danger sense
- DM has 8 fear
